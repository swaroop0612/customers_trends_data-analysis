🛒 Consumer Shopping Behavior Analysis — Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview
This project focuses on understanding customer shopping behavior using real-world retail data.
The goal is to identify purchasing trends, analyze the factors that influence customer decisions, and provide insights that help improve marketing, sales, and customer engagement strategies.
The complete workflow covers Python-based analysis, SQL exploration, Power BI dashboarding, and reporting.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer shopping information such as:
    Customer demographics
    Product categories
    Order details
    Discounts and payment types
    Ratings and reviews
    Online vs. offline purchases
Data is used only for learning and analysis purposes.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python — Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn
ProStringy SQL Server — SQL querying
Power BI — Interactive dashboard
Gamma — PPD (Professional Presentation Document)
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code — Development environment

🔍 Project Steps

1️⃣ Load & Inspect Data (Python)

Load CSV dataset using Pandas
Check data types, missing values, duplicates
Understand dataset structure

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handle missing values
Fix inconsistent formats
Remove duplicates
Standardize column names
Clean categorical and numeric fields

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed visual and statistical analysis to answer questions like:
Which products are most purchased?
Do discounts increase sales?
What time of year has higher demand?
Which payment method is preferred?
How does customer age influence spending?
EDA includes charts, summaries, and key insights.

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (ProStringy SQL Server)

Executed SQL queries to explore:
Customer segments
Top-selling products
Revenue trends
Repeat purchase behavior
High-value customers
Helps validate Python insights using structured querying.

5️⃣ Build Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard showing:
Sales trends
Category-wise performance
Customer demographics
Revenue breakdown
Payment preferences
Seasonal patterns
Designed for quick decision-making and stakeholder review.

6️⃣ Create a Report

A clean, organized report summarizing:
Business problem
Approach
Key findings
Visual insights
Recommendations

7️⃣ Generate PPD using Gamma

Final presentation created in Gamma for easy sharing with recruiters, mentors, or stakeholders.

📊 Dashboard Preview

The Power BI dashboard includes:

  KPIs (Total Sales, Orders, Avg. Rating, etc.)
  Category performance charts
  Monthly sales trends
  Age & gender segmentation
  Discounts vs. purchase behavior
  Region-wise insights
  Designed to be clean, modern, and easy to interpret.

🧠 Key Results & Insights

Identified top-performing product categories
Discovered how discount levels influence conversion
Found high-value and repeat customer segments
Highlighted peak shopping seasons
Revealed payment preferences and channel differences
Provided actionable recommendations for marketing and product teams
